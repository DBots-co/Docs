### Step 2

**Add a Bot** [Login]([https://dbots.co/login) to the DBots Dashboard to your server. This will redirect you to a Discord OAuth2 link which should auto login to DBots, with your currently logged-in Discord account. After logging into the dashboard, you can [add a bot](/dashboard/bots/new) by clicking on the '+' icon.
